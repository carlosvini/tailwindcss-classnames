## Adding new features from TailwindCSS

First thing is to look at their [release notes](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases), then update tailwindcss and the default config file by running:

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss@^RELEASE_VERSION
yarn run updateConfig
```

This will update [`src/cli/lib/defaultTailwindConfig.ts`](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames/blob/develop/src/cli/lib/defaultTailwindConfig.ts) with the latest tailwind config and
the CLI will use this file to automatically generate the following classes:

- new [pseudoclass variants](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames/blob/61913c02330efdb746ba6da9a2464ca64ed6471c/src/cli/core/ClassesGenerator.ts#L317) e.g. `hover:flex`, `focus:flex`, `md:flex` etc.
- new classnames that are based on new _values_ in config. e.g. in tailwind v2 they added font sizing like `text-7xl`. the new config will have this value and thus will be [generated by the CLI](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames/blob/61913c02330efdb746ba6da9a2464ca64ed6471c/src/cli/core/ClassesGenerator.ts#L305).

The above will update _existing_ classes that got new _values_.
For new _classnames_:

- classes that their name cannot be customized should be added to [`src/cli/lib/non-configurable/CORRESPONDING_CATEGORY.ts`](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames/tree/develop/src/cli/lib/non-configurable).
 An example for these would be `flex`, `block` (non-configurable/layout) or `capitalize` (non-configurable/typography).

- classes that their name can be customized (like `bg-red-100`, sizing classes `w-6`, etc.) each should be added to corresponding category method in [`ClassnamesGenerator`](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames/blob/master/src/cli/core/ClassnamesGenerator.ts) class.

After doing this for new classes, the CLI would be compatible with new tailwind release.

Now `src/index.ts` can be updated with the new types by running:

```bash
yarn run generate
```
